      "By Chuck Mikolajczak 4 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar turned higher against a basket of major currencies on Friday after a dismal December U.S. payrolls raised expectations for further stimulus measures to prop up an economy battered by the coronavirus and its related government lockdown measures. The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls decreased by 140,000 in December, the first decline in eight months, well below expectations that called for a still-weak increase of 71,000 jobs. The unemployment rate was 6.7%. Economic data during the week leading up to Friday’s report indicated a stalling labor market. The greenback had been climbing from a nearly three-year low on Thursday as a rise in U.S. yields helped fuel the unwinding of bearish bets on the currency, with traders taking profits against the euro in particular. After a brief pullback after the release of the data, the greenback resumed its path higher, as expectations grew for additional stimulus measures to help buttress the economy until vaccine rollouts allow for the easing of lockdown measures. “You would’ve thought you would get a number like this, and you would say to yourself here comes that downward pressure or weakness into play and, lo and behold, the market says you’re not right, we are going to go a little bit stronger,” said JB Mackenzie, Managing Director for Futures & Forex at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. “You do have some expectations priced into the dollar of increased stimulus coming through, obviously the new presidency coming in as well, so expectations got priced in right off the bat so that is why you are seeing it holding.” The dollar index last rose 0.35% at 90.117 after touching a high of 90.252, it’s best level since Jan 1. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden said the jobs report shows Americans needed more immediate relief now and that taking action now would help the economy even with deficit financing, including $2,000 stimulus checks. The Democrats’ Senate seat wins give Biden latitude to push through more spending, which some analysts predict will fuel risk appetite and be negative for bonds and the dollar, although a strongly bearish consensus outlook for the greenback at the end of 2020 has eased somewhat. The dollar index dropped 7% in 2020 and as much as 0.9% in the first few days of the new year on expectations of U.S. fiscal stimulus. But since hitting its lowest level since March 2018, the greenback has found some footing, climbing as much as 1.2% over two sessions. Both the euro and the pound weakened against the dollar as it gained ground. The euro was last down 0.5% to $1.2209 while sterling was last trading at $1.3562, down 0.01% on the day. Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high of $41,802.84, and last rose 2.39% to $40,454.81, after smashing through $40,000 for the first time on Thursday.

      "By Chuck Mikolajczak 4 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar bounced on Thursday from levels not touched since March 2018 to its highest in a week as investors looked at the potential for an economic rebound in upcoming quarters and investors who had been betting on the euro took profits. The dollar index , which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of peers, rose 0.53% at 89.785 after climbing as high as 89.979, with the euro down 0.43% to $1.2272. The dollar had little movement on Wednesday as hundreds of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to overturn his election defeat, battling police in the hallways and delaying for hours the certification of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. [nL1N2JI0JO] Biden’s victory has raised expectations for more fiscal stimulus measures to bolster the economic outlook and lifted longer-dated bond yields, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury’s yield climbing above 1% on Wednesday for the first time since March. On Thursday, the yield reached a high of 1.088%. “Once the rates start to move, as they did yesterday, it wasn’t a big move but it was in the right direction, that is the direction of the future,” said Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FXStreet.com. “It’s debatable on how long it is going to take for the vaccines to work and hopefully end the pandemic but once that happens, you are going to get a much stronger U.S. recovery and that will lead to a stronger dollar.” Economic data on Thursday, however, underscored a stalling labor market, although a gauge of activity in the services industry quickened in December. Still, many analysts maintain a weaker long-term outlook for the dollar and see the recent advance as the unwinding of bearish bets against the greenback, after it fell nearly 7% in 2020 and as much as 0.9% in the new year. The yuan edged lower at 6.47 per dollar CNH=EBS after Chinese authorities signaled a desire for a slower pace of gains. The remarks by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Wednesday follow an advance of around 10% on the greenback since last May as China’s economic rebound has led the world’s pandemic recovery. Sterling was last trading at $1.3568, down 0.29% on the day as it continued to slip below the near three-year high of $1.3703 touched on Monday. Bitcoin marked a fresh all-time high, topping $40,000 on Thursday, and was last up 6.24% at $39,148.91.

      "By Chuck Mikolajczak 4 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar bounced after sinking to its lowest level in nearly three years on Wednesday, with markets anticipating a Democrat win in the U.S. Senate election in Georgia that would clear the path for a larger fiscal stimulus package. Democrats won one U.S. Senate race in Georgia and led in another on Wednesday, edging closer to a sweep in a previous Republican stronghold that would hand them control of Congress and the power to advance President-elect Joe Biden’s policy goals. Analysts generally expect a Democrat-controlled Senate to be positive for economic growth globally and thus for most riskier assets, but negative for bonds and the dollar as the U.S. budget and trade deficits swell even further. As markets priced in the Democrats winning both Georgia seats, the dollar index hit its lowest since March 2018 at 89.206, but rebounded to last trade up 0.015% at 89.48. Fueling expectations of further stimulus measures was a weak report on the labor market in the form of the ADP National Employment Report, which showed private payrolls post their first decline in eight months as coronavirus cases surge. However, a reading on factory orders for November exceeded expectations and indicated a sustained manufacturing recovery. But after a fall of nearly 7% in 2020 and a drop of as much as 0.9% in the new year, the dollar turned higher as a crowded trade began to unwind, which was also supported by a climb in interest rates. Analysts still expect the longer-term trend for the greenback to be weaker, however. nL1N2JH1B9] “People have been bearish on the dollar now for at least six or nine months,” said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. “Obviously you are going to have to take a little bit of a breather every now and then.” The euro gave up earlier gains and was up 0.11% to $1.2312, after earlier having risen past major resistance to as high as $1.2349. Riskier currencies also surged, with the New Zealand dollar and Australian dollar touching their highest in nearly three years and holding onto most of the gains even as the dollar recovered. The move was helped by a range of surveys overnight showing that manufacturing globally had proved resilient in December, despite rising coronavirus cases. Elsewhere, U.S. President Donald Trump escalated tensions with Beijing by signing an executive order banning U.S. transactions with eight Chinese software applications. After surging on Monday and Tuesday, the yuan softened, after China’s central bank appeared to signal a preference for a more moderate pace of intervention. The yuan has gained around 10% on the dollar since last May as China’s economic rebound has led the world’s pandemic recovery. Bitcoin traded above $35,000 for the first time, rising to $35,879.35 in the Asian session and extending a rally that has seen it rise more the 800% since mid-March. The gains eased slightly, with the cryptocurrency last up 4.81% at $35,676.61.

      "By Chuck Mikolajczak 4 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, in the wake of China’s decision to lift its official yuan exchange rate by its highest margin since it abandoned a dollar peg in 2005, while U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia were also eyed. China’s central bank set the official yuan midpoint at 6.4760 per dollar before the market opened, up 1% from the previous fix, the biggest change higher since 2005. In the offshore market, the yuan strengthened as far as 6.4119 for the first time since mid-June 2018. It started the week at 6.494. The dollar briefly strengthened in a risk-off move on Monday as U.S. stocks dropped, but resumed their downward trajectory in the wake of China’s announcement, which also helped lift risk currencies. After initially opening lower, U.S. stocks turned higher to further dent the dollar’s attractiveness, with the outlook of the Georgia runoffs in focus. A Democratic victory in both races could take control of the Senate away from Republicans, paving the way for further stimulus measures as well as higher corporate taxes and more regulation. “Based off of the track record of Republicans on Election Day, there is still that belief that they are going to at least be able to win one of these races; if that happens, we don’t have to worry about the massive fiscal support” expected from a Democratic-controlled Senate, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. “Because it has been so heavily in one direction, right now we are at some key support levels for the dollar index that we are probably going to see some choppy trade here.” The dollar index fell 0.215% to 89.672. The New York Stock Exchange said it no longer intends to de-list three Chinese telecom companies. The surprising reversal of an announcement made only last week added to confusion over a U.S. crackdown on companies said to be linked to China’s military. The Aussie dollar , a barometer of risk appetite that also tends to follow the yuan, was up 0.74% at 0.7722, approaching the 2-1/2-year high of .7743 touched on the final day of 2020. The euro was up 0.19% at $1.2271 while the Japanese yen strengthened 0.32% versus the greenback at 102.80 per dollar. Sterling was last trading at $1.3592, up 0.17%, having been buffeted by a surge in infections of a fast-spreading new coronavirus variant in the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordering another nationwide lockdown. It slid 0.73% on Monday, the most since Dec. 10, after earlier rising to $1.3703, a level not seen since May 2018. Bitcoin traded at $32,045.29 following a roller-coaster ride that took it to a record high of $34,800 on Sunday, followed by a tumble to as low as $27,734 the following session.

      "By Karen Brettell 4 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) - The euro was boosted on Monday as risk sentiment improved in the wake of Britain’s trade deal with the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to approve a new fiscal stimulus package. Britain on Thursday clinched a narrow Brexit trade deal with the EU, just seven days before it exits one of the world’s biggest trading blocs in its most significant global shift since the loss of its empire. “What we are seeing is a continuation of the pricing out of hard Brexit risk,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of FX research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. Risk sentiment also improved after Trump on Sunday signed into law a $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package, restoring unemployment benefits to millions of Americans and averting a federal government shutdown. The euro gained 0.43% to 126.77 yen. It reached a seven-month high of 1.0892 against the Swiss franc, before falling back to 1.0858, up 0.04% on the day. The single currency was down 0.09% against the U.S. dollar at $1.2209. It gained 1.00% against sterling to 0.9077. Sterling has underperformed since the Brexit deal was reached, with traders saying the news was likely priced in. Also “I would argue that this is markets slowly but surely acknowledging that this is not an optimal deal for the UK,” said Andreas Steno Larsen, global chief FX and rates strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen. “This is rather a very slim deal that merely avoids the cliff edge, but there are still large gaps that will have to be dealt with in 2021, and frictionless trade is not secured,” Larsen said. The British pound dipped 0.66% against the U.S. dollar to $1.3447, and was holding below a two-and-a-half-year high of $1.3625 reached on Dec. 17. Bitcoin climbed 2.74% to $26,695 but was below a record high $28,378 reached on Sunday. “There is a lot of enthusiasm among (crypto) traders who truly believe in this asset class, and they know that the rally has only begun because we were only recovering losses for the past few years,” Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, said in a report. The dollar gained 0.14% against a basket of currencies to 90.32. Investors are betting the dollar will continue to decline - it fell more than 6% this year - on expectations the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates near zero and the U.S. economy will struggle to recover from coronavirus-related shutdowns. Win Thin, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, expects the dollar index to test its February 2018 low of 88.25. Then “what happens to the greenback after that will largely depend on how well the U.S. controls the virus in 2021 as well as the outlook for further fiscal stimulus,” Thin said in a report. The dollar slipped 0.16% against the Canadian dollar to $1.2848.

      "By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss 4 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged higher on Thursday, while sterling gained in a holiday-thinned session, after Britain and the European Union struck a post-Brexit trade deal, raising hopes the United Kingdom can avoid a turbulent economic departure at the end of the year. Financial markets are closed on Friday for Christmas day. Britain on Thursday clinched a trade deal with the European Union, seven days before it exits one of the world’s biggest trading blocs in its most significant global shift since the loss of empire. Sterling pared gains after the Brexit trade announcement, while the dollar retraced some of its losses, as investors have already priced in the deal and have taken profits. “If we parse through the litany of self-congratulatory headlines pouring out, we get the sense that sterling/dollar traders have ‘bought-the-rumor’ and are now simply ‘selling the fact’ given the lack of any new positive surprises announced so far…they more or less got what they priced in,” said Erik Bregar, head of FX strategy, at Exchange Bank of Canada. In early afternoon, the dollar index was slightly higher at 90.33. On the week, the dollar index was up 0.4%, enough to post its highest weekly gain since mid-November. So far this year, however, the dollar has fallen 6.4%, its worst yearly performance since 2017. Sterling rose as high as $1.3620. It was last up 0.3% at $1.3544, with the potential to rise to a 2-1/2 year high above $1.3625. The pound also rose to a three-week peak against the euro at 89.54 pence. The euro was last down 0.4% versus sterling at 89.95 pence. “From what we know so far, this (trade deal) is merely enough to avoid a cliff-edge scenario and keep goods from queuing up at borders, but it is not a broad-based trade agreement that includes services,” said Andreas Steno Larsen, chief global FX and rates strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen, “So this is an OK scenario for the UK but probably not much more than that, which is also why sterling is not truly celebrating the deal.” Currency markets also seemed to have shrugged off President Donald Trump’s criticism of the fiscal relief package earlier approved in Congress, which could put the bill in limbo. Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday blocked attempts to alter a $2.3 trillion coronavirus aid and government spending package, leaving its status in doubt after Trump demanded extensive changes to the legislation. Against currencies tied to higher risk appetite, the dollar weakened. The Australian dollar rose 0.3% to US$0.7599 while the New Zealand dollar was up 0.2% at US$0.7109.

      "By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss 4 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell from 10-day highs on Monday in a holiday-shortened week, as investors looked past concerns about a fast-spreading new coronavirus strain prevalent in Britain and focused on the U.S. stimulus package set to be voted on by Congress. Analysts said volatile moves are typical at this time of the year when volumes are thin. Market sentiment was helped as well by remarks from the World Health Organization, which tried to ease concerns about the latest virus mutation. WHO said on Monday coronavirus mutations had so far been much slower than with influenza and that even the new UK variant remained much less transmissible than other diseases like mumps. It added that vaccines developed to combat COVID-19 should handle the new variants as well, although checks were underway to ensure this was the case. “Level heads have prevailed once people realized that the variant will still be affected by the current vaccines being deployed,” said Amo Sahota, executive director at currency advisory firm Klarity FX in San Francisco. “If it has been the case that the vaccines are not effective against this variant, then I think it’s a totally different situation.” Investors have started to focus more on the U.S. stimulus bill that is likely to get voted later on Monday. In afternoon trading, the dollar index fell 0.2% to 90.097, Last week, the safe-haven greenback sank to two-and-a-half-year lows, driven by optimism that vaccines would help to revive global growth. Earlier on Monday, it rose to a 10-day peak of 91.022. The euro fell 0.2% to $1.22331, after earlier dropping to a more than one-week trough. “We’ve noticed a couple waves of ‘buy-the-dip’ emerge in Europe today and we think this is because today’s pullback is a counter-trend,” said Erik Bregar, head of FX strategy, at Exchange Bank of Canada in Toronto. Sterling fell to a 10-day low against the dollar and euro, as two-year British government bonds dropped to a record low. Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought an emergency response to the crisis. The pound cut losses though versus the dollar to trade just 0.4% lower at $1.3448, while the euro clung to thin gains against sterling and was last up 0.1% at 90.85 pence. Bitcoin, meanwhile, fell 2.7% after hitting a record high of $24,298.04 on Sunday. The virtual currency was last down at $22,844.18. Total investor inflows into cryptocurrency funds and products hit $5.6 billion so far this year, up more than 600% from 2019, according to the latest data from asset manager CoinShares. The riskier Australian and New Zealand dollars weakened at the start of the week as investors rushed for haven assets. The Aussie dollar dropped 0.6% to 75.80 U.S. cents, while the New Zealand dollar fell 0.6% to 71 U.S. cents. The U.S. dollar was little changed against the yen to 103.34 yen.

      "By Suzanne Barlyn 4 MIN READ (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar zigzagged to a session high and back on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve disappointed investors expecting a shift toward more purchases of longer-dated bonds, while investors kept their focus on Bitcoin, which smashed through $20,000 for the first time. The U.S. dollar index rose to 90.713 after the Fed’s rate-setting committee on Wednesday said its monthly government bond purchase program will continue until the economy substantially improves. But the dollar soon gave back the increase, again hovering near a two-year low. The dollar index was last at 90.2970, down 0.20%. “I think so much of it is about what the Fed didn’t do, specifically extending the maturity of the purchases or the pace of the purchases, and there were obviously some who had expected they would do that,” said Erik Nelson, a macro strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. The policy sends a signal that the Fed is comfortable with some increases in longer-term U.S. yields, Nelson said. “I’m not sure markets were fully aware of that,” he said. Investors earlier on Wednesday were largely focused on Bitcoin, which has gained more than 170% this year, buoyed by demand from larger investors attracted to its potential for quick gains, purported inflation-resistant qualities, and expectations it will become a mainstream payment method. Bitcoin was up 7.15% on the day to $20,824. One impetus for the rise is that “it is starting to get a wider and more respectable client base, more businesses and more of the larger investors, so that makes it maybe more sustainable,” said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. That said, “it’s not going to be without its hiccups along the way.” Wall Street remained mixed after the Fed’s announcement, with the Nasdaq hitting a record high as investors awaited a potential fiscal economic stimulus package and the Fed repeated a pledge to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero. Investors continue to eye progress with COVID-19 vaccine distribution. U.S. officials are working with Pfizer Inc to help maximize production capacity after the drugmaker told them it may be facing production challenges, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said on Wednesday. The Swiss franc earlier on Wednesday touched a six-year high after the U.S. Treasury labeled Switzerland a currency manipulator. The Treasury said that through June 2020 both Switzerland and Vietnam had intervened in currency markets to prevent effective balance of payments adjustments, a move that investors shrugged off. The Swiss franc was last at 0.8856, with the dollar down 0.02% against the currency on the day, while the Vietnamese dong was last at 23,126, little changed on the day. Strong euro zone survey figures and hopes of progress on Brexit negotiations pushed the euro above $1.2212 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday for the first time since April 2018, but later notched downward. Against the U.S. dollar, the euro was last at $1.2186, up 0.29%.

      "By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss 4 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar edged higher on Tuesday in choppy trading, taking a breather from a sell-off that took it to its lowest level in more than 2-1/2 years last week, while sterling slipped as investors awaited the outcome of Brexit trade-deal talks. An index tracking the dollar’s value rose 0.1% to 90.95. So far this year, the dollar was down nearly 6%, on pace for its weakest yearly performance since 2017. “The monetary and fiscal stimuli we’re seeing is going to reflate the world and that leads to a weaker dollar and should be good for risk and emerging market currencies,” said Axel Merk, president and chief investment officer at Merk Investments, which oversees $1 billion in assets. Positive vaccine news from Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer Inc on Tuesday supported equities and lifted risk appetite, but the dollar held its own. [.N] Upbeat economic sentiment data from Germany lifted the euro earlier in the session, but it was last flat to slightly lower at $1.2104. German investor sentiment soared more than expected in December on expectations that vaccines against the coronavirus would boost the outlook for Europe’s largest economy. The ZEW economic research institute said its survey of investors’ economic sentiment moved up to 55.0 from 39.0 in the previous month. A Reuters poll had forecast a reading of 45.5. So far this year, the euro has gained roughly 8% versus the greenback. Dominic Bunning, head of European FX Research, at HSBC wrote in his latest research note, that the euro’s strength, which has been more aggressive than in the summer, could be problematic for the European Central Bank. “A stronger currency tightens financial conditions, which is incredibly unhelpful for an economy facing persistent disinflationary pressures,” Bunning said. The ECB holds its monetary policy meeting on Thursday. Investors, meanwhile, continued to focus on Brexit trade deal talks. With only three weeks to go for Britain to fully complete its exit from the European Union, leaders have failed to narrow differences on a post-Brexit trade deal. The pound though trimmed earlier losses and briefly popped into positive territory after Britain said it had clinched a deal with the European Union over how to manage the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.[GBP/] Against the dollar, the pound was last down 0.2% at $1.3354. It was also 0.1% lower against the euro, which rose to 90.63 pence . Implied volatility on the pound - a measure of expected future swings in the currency - hit eight-month highs, a sign that traders were preparing for gyrations. The dollar was up 0.1% against the yen at 104.16 yen, but fell 0.2% versus the Swiss franc to 0.8893 franc.

      "By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss, Suzanne Barlyn 5 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose from 2-1/2-year lows on Friday, as European Union and British negotiators paused talks for a post-Brexit trade deal, weighing on sterling, though the greenback still posted its worst week in a month after investors shrugged off a weaker-than-expected U.S. employment report. In late trading, the dollar index rose 0.1% to $90.725 ahead of the weekend, climbing from its lowest level since April 2018. On the week, the index was down 1.3%, its largest weekly loss since early November. Britain and the European Union paused talks on Friday after failing to narrow differences sufficiently to reach a trade agreement, less than four weeks before Britain completes its Brexit journey out of the bloc. The negotiators, Britain’s David Frost and the EU’s Michel Barnier, said they would brief their leaders to seek new impetus for the talks. Upbeat announcements on COVID-19 vaccines have helped drive a rally in riskier currencies at the expense of the safe-haven dollar. Graphic: Dollar in free fall? - The euro and Swiss franc, in contrast, were headed for their best week in a month against the dollar. The single European currency touched a 2-1/2-year high, while the Swiss franc rose to its highest in nearly six years. Data showed that U.S. non-farm payrolls increased by 245,000 jobs last month after rising by 610,000 in October. That was the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. “The biggest development this afternoon has been what I’m telling clients is a ‘fakeout-breakout’ in pound sterling,” said Toronto-based Erik Bregar, head of FX strategy for the Exchange Bank of Canada, referring to the possibility of a Brexit deal that is now on pause. “It makes me think about more downside afterwards.” The renewed possibility that Congress might forge another U.S. fiscal stimulus package and enthusiasm about progress on the development of COVID-19 vaccines remain key drivers in foreign exchange, strategists said. The jobs data and surge in COVID-19 cases are unlikely to trigger a rush by the U.S. Federal Reserve to ramp up its bond-buying. Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans told reporters on Friday that the Fed could assess asset purchases in springtime, when there is more clarity on the economic outlook. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday there was momentum behind talks on a coronavirus relief bill and that a bipartisan proposal could be the basis for relief negotiations. That should keep risk appetite higher. The euro has been one of the biggest winners from recent dollar weakness, breaking decisively above $1.20 this week. The single currency rose to $1.2177, its highest since April 2018, and was last down 0.2% at $1.2118. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar recovered to trade slightly higher at 0.8910 franc, after earlier dropping to a nearly six-year low of 0.8886 franc. The greenback was last down .06% at 0.8903. The dollar gained 0.3% against the yen to 104.15 yen.

      "By David Henry 5 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar resumed its slide on Monday and reached multi-year lows against the British pound and the Australian dollar as traders focused on the promise of coronavirus vaccinations and the outlooks for economic growth and inflation that could push bond yields higher. The U.S. dollar index was last down 0.3% in afternoon trading in New York at 90.046 and about even for the year. The dollar has been trending down in February and has now given up about all of its January recovery from a 2020 decline of nearly 7%. The dollar’s latest retreat comes with spreading belief that the U.S. will go farther than necessary to support the economy with government spending and easy money policies and end up with too much inflation and too much additional debt. Looking for any sign that the U.S. Federal Reserve might become less dovish and more mindful of inflation, markets will be watching testimony on Tuesday from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to the Senate Banking Committee. The dollar’s downtrend has come as the benchmark yield on 10-year Treasury notes has climbed to 1.37% from 1.1% at end of January. The 10-year yield was relatively steady in trading on Monday in advance of Powell’s testimony, which will go into a second day on Wednesday before another committee. “The dollar continues to wax and wane with U.S. data that have painted a mixed picture of the world’s biggest economy,” Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, said in a note on Monday. Weakness in U.S. employment has been undermining dollar rallies as markets see wavering jobs data reinforcing the Federal Reserve’s commitment to low interest rates, Manimbo added. The euro rose 0.4% against the dollar to $1.2162. Data on Monday showed German business morale rose more than expected in February due notably to the country’s resilient industrial sector. Exchange rates between the euro and dollar will depend “on whether the U.S. economy really will be able to achieve a stronger post-lockdown boom than Europe,” Commerzbank analyst Ulrich Leuchtmann said. The British pound was last up 0.5% to $1.4066 and the highest levels since April 2018 as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a path out of lockdowns on the UK’s relative success providing COVID-19 vaccinations. “We’ve clearly started to price in a lot of good news,” said Ned Rumpeltin, head of European currency strategy at TD Securities. The U.S. dollar fell to three-year lows against the Australian dollar, which benefits from rising commodity prices. The Aussie was last up to $0.7917, at its highest levels since March 2018. “Commodity currencies and the pound are particularly strong against the dollar, and this trend looks set to continue,” said Yukio Ishizuki, foreign exchange strategist at Daiwa Securities. Australia on Monday began its mass COVID-19 vaccine programme as the country looked set to report no local cases for the third straight day, which gave the Aussie a boost. Bitcoin fell 6% on Monday to $53,866 after surging to a record high of $58,354 a day earlier. The cryptocurrency pared losses as fallling as much as 16% on Monday and going as low as $47,400.

      "By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss 4 MIN READ NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar on Friday rose against major currencies such as the euro and yen, with traders consolidating positions amid competing forces that pull the currency in different directions: the surge in virus cases, on the one hand, and positive vaccine news, on the other. The possible resumption of U.S. stimulus talks for COVID-19 relief has also weighed on the dollar as a safe haven. Republican and Democratic senators agreed on Thursday to revive those discussions Overall, the greenback ended the week on a loss against a currency basket. The week started off on a negative note for the dollar with positive news on a vaccine for COVID-19, but the market has since moved back and forth between focusing on coronavirus cases and the virus drug. Pfizer Inc PFE.N said it had applied for emergency use authorization in the United States for its COVID-19 vaccine. “We think we are in the early stages of a recovery in the global economy and trade from the shock of the pandemic and this will further” weigh on the dollar and support the euro,” Jonathan Petersen, markets economist, at Capital Economics, said. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, meanwhile, defended on Friday his decision to end several of the Federal Reserve’s key pandemic lending programs on Dec. 31, saying Congress should use the money to help small U.S. companies with grants instead. The dollar briefly rose overnight after the Mnuchin news late Thursday. “The request comes as most lending facilities haven’t been tapped for more than the amount committed by the Treasury to backstop the programmes, suggesting market functionality is sufficient to warrant their expiration,” said Monex Europe in a research note. In afternoon trading, the dollar was flat against a currency basket at 92.369 in a quiet day for currency markets. The euro was down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.1859 EUR=EBS, posting a small weekly gain. Action Economics noted some pre-weekend selling in the euro going into the London close. “The lack of progress between the European Union and the U.K. on Brexit trade talks has likely kept a cap on the euro despite generally waning U.S. dollar sentiment,” it said in its daily blog. The Australian dollar - seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite - posted its best monthly gain versus the U.S. dollar since April. It last traded up 0.4% at US$0.7308 AUD=D3. The New Zealand dollar hit new two-year highs of US$0.6951 NZD=D3, helped by positive risk appetite. It was last up 0.3% at US$0.6938. The U.S. dollar was up 0.1% versus the yen at 103.81 yen JPY=EBS. Elsewhere, Bitcoin BTC=BTSP rose to a three-year high of $18,824 on Friday, getting close to its all-time high of just under $20,000. It was last up 4.6% at $18,646.15.

      "By Olga Cotaga 2 MIN READ LONDON (Reuters) - Sterling traded at a one-week high on Wednesday, helped by a weaker U.S. dollar and by hopes that Britain will forge a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union in time for its departure from the customs union and single market in January. Those hopes have been fed by recent positive comments from British government officials, but also by the announcement that Dominic Cummings, one of the political architects of the Brexit project, was set to leave the government. The EU’s Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said on Wednesday that Britain and the bloc were in the last moments to reach a trade deal. “In case we get more optimistic headlines regarding a deal, and conditional upon risk-on returning into the markets, the pound is likely to perform better against the safe havens, the likes of the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc,” said Charalambos Pissouros, senior market analyst at JFD Group. The pound was last trading up 0.4% at $1.3307 -- a one week high -- and also by the same extent against the euro at 89.17 pence. It was neutral versus the Japanese yen at 138.08. British inflation picked up by a little more than expected in October, pushed higher by prices for clothing and footwear and food. As England remained in full lockdown, on Tuesday reporting 598 deaths within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test, the highest figure since May, worries persisted about how detrimental this could prove for the British economy. Hopes that a vaccine could soon become available received a boost after two pharmaceutical companies recently reported successful results. Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said the economic outlook for 2021 was “materially brighter” than he had expected just a few weeks ago. BoE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said on Tuesday that positive news about COVID-19 vaccines could help to reduce the risks facing Britain’s economy but that the central bank was unlikely to revise up its forecasts as a result.
