# Crawler/Scrapper

A nodeJS application that utilises Pupeteer in order to scrape financial news

The instructions on how to scrape data are written in the configs directory as json files.

This application can be executed locally and through docker

The same code is used for both crawling (feching urls form index pages) amd scraping (fetching the content from the url)
